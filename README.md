Welcome to a resource from the comparative chronomics group hosted on GitHub

The **cardiac drug plotter** is intended to aid in planning for clinical trial design when considering drugs with targets that have circadian expression. 

This tool is currently hosted on the shinyapps server at:
<https://chronomics.shinyapps.io/CardiacDrugPlotter/>

The underlying code and data can be downloaded from the GitHub repository linked in the header of this page.

### Usage

Upon loading the plotter displays an idealised diurnal heart rate in white, and drug target in teal. To aid in [using the drug plotter](https://chronomics.shinyapps.io/CardiacDrugPlotter/) please follow these steps:

- Select a drug from the first drop down menu
- Select a target of the drug from the second drop down menu
- The plot will update to display the peak phase of the drug in teal

### How do I use this information?

This tool is intended to help you consider the optimum time for measuring heart rate in conjunction with the circadian dynamics of the drug you are testing. The underlying data is taken from [Ruben et al., 2018](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30209245/). The sine curves are plotted based on the timing predicted by CYCLOPS.
